## Introduction


## Episode Themes

- The podcast covers topics related to the Doctrine of Christian Discovery, exploring interconnections between colonialism, Christianity, and the suppression of Indigenous perspectives and relationships with the natural world.
- Kimberly Carfore discusses her work in ecofeminist theology and the transformative power of wilderness experiences, noting the divisiveness of language like "feminism" and the need to find collaborative approaches to healing relationships between men and women.
- The conversation delves into the significance of fire and the Haudenosaunee creation story, highlighting how Indigenous worldviews foreground the natural world's agency and the importance of being in right relationship with the Earth.
- The participants reflect on their ancestry and grapple with the traumas and injustices present in their family histories, emphasizing the need to engage with the past in order to understand the present and work towards a more just future.
- Adam provides an insightful analysis connecting the discussion to the Doctrine of Christian Discovery, the tradition of dominion theology, and the vital importance of centering Indigenous values and wisdom in addressing current socio-ecological crises.
- Kimberly proposes the idea of conceptualizing "Earth as Mother God" as a theological framework for reorienting the dominant Christian tradition towards more holistic and relational perspectives.

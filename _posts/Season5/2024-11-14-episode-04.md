## Introduction

We begin this episode with a [land acknowledgement](https://podcast.doctrineofdiscovery.org/land/).

Welcome to the Mapping the Doctrine of Discovery podcast, hosted by Philip P. Arnold and Sandy Bigtree. In this compelling episode, we are honored to welcome Steven J. Schwartzberg as our special guest. Schwartzberg, an accomplished political science instructor at DePaul University and author of [*Arguments Over Genocide: The War of Words in the Congress and the Supreme Court over Cherokee Removal*](https://ethicspress.com/products/arguments-over-genocide/?GENOCIDE), brings a profound perspective to the discussion. This episode delves into the historical roots and the ongoing impact of the [Doctrine of Christian Discovery](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/), tracing its origins from Catholic papal bulls to its adoption by Protestant colonial powers and its enduring influence on American law through the pivotal decisions of Chief Justice John Marshall. Together, the hosts and guest examine how this doctrine justified the subjugation and dispossession of Indigenous peoples, its intersections with Christian nationalism and states' rights, and the implications for contemporary struggles over tribal sovereignty and justice. Join us as we explore the pathways toward healing and the critical call for recognizing and addressing the legacies of this unjust history.

- The discussion explores the [Doctrine of Christian Discovery](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/) and its lasting impact on Indigenous peoples in the United States. It traces how this doctrine, rooted in Catholic papal bulls and later adopted by Protestant colonial powers, has shaped American law and national identity through figures like Chief Justice John Marshall.

- The speakers argue that the [Doctrine of Christian Discovery](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/) represents a false and violent universalism that has been used to justify the domination and genocide of Indigenous nations. They contrast this with the more egalitarian, interconnected worldviews and governance structures of many Indigenous peoples.

- The discussion highlights how the impacts of the [Doctrine of Christian Discovery](https://doctrineofdiscovery.org/) persist today through ongoing issues like Christian nationalism, states' rights, and the denial of tribal sovereignty. The speakers call for a reckoning with the grief and injustice caused by this history, as a pathway towards more just and equitable relations.

*Arguments Over Genocide: The War of Words in the Congress and the Supreme Court over Cherokee Removal* by Steven J. Schwartzberg.

The latest episode of our podcast, "Unveiling the Doctrine of Discovery: Historical Injustice and Pathways to Healing," delves into the profound and often overlooked impact of the Doctrine of Discovery on Indigenous peoples and the legacy it has left in shaping U.S. history and society. This episode is enriched by the insights of Steve Schwartzberg, a political science instructor and former Congressional candidate, who provides a compelling narrative on the intertwining of historical doctrines, legal supremacy, and modern injustices.

One of the central themes discussed in the episode is the enduring influence of the Doctrine of Discovery, a concept rooted in the 15th-century papal bulls that sanctioned Christian European nations to claim non-Christian lands. This doctrine laid the groundwork for the systematic disenfranchisement of Indigenous peoples, an issue that continues to echo through legal and political frameworks today. The episode explores how figures like Chief Justice John Marshall perpetuated these injustices through pivotal court decisions, which continue to impact Native American sovereignty and rights.

The discussion is further deepened by examining the role of Christian theology in the perpetuation of these doctrines. The podcast scrutinizes the exclusionary practices embedded in Christian theology, contrasting them with Indigenous perspectives on divinity and interconnectedness. This juxtaposition invites listeners to reassess the implications of religious rhetoric that has historically justified oppression and violence, offering a counter-narrative that emphasizes harmony and respect for all relations.

The episode also sheds light on the interplay between historical and modern political themes, drawing parallels between past and present struggles for justice. By analyzing the 1830s debates on states' rights and Native American treaties, the conversation critiques the moral depravity that allowed for the marginalization and genocide of Native Nations. This historical context provides a lens through which to view current political issues, highlighting the persistence of these challenges in modern America.

In a poignant exploration of grief and healing, the episode draws inspiration from the Onondaga Nation's practices, emphasizing the transformative power of acknowledging historical injustices. This perspective encourages a shift from guilt to love and interconnectedness, suggesting that true reconciliation can only be achieved through genuine relationships with one another and the earth. By confronting historical myths and manipulations, such as those surrounding figures like Columbus, the episode advocates for a more inclusive and understanding future.

Throughout the episode, the conversation with Steve Schwartzberg offers a personal touch, as he shares his motivations for advocating issues like Medicare for All and tribal sovereignty during his Congressional campaign. His insights provide a bridge between historical analysis and modern advocacy, illustrating how individuals can contribute to the broader movement for justice and reconciliation.

In summary, this podcast episode invites listeners to embark on a journey of understanding and reflection, challenging them to confront historical injustices and explore pathways to healing. By revisiting past doctrines and their modern implications, the episode offers hope for a future grounded in inclusivity, respect, and interconnectedness. It serves as a call to action for all who seek to create a more just and equitable world, rooted in the recognition of our shared humanity and the enduring legacy of the past.

### Prelminary Study
*The Written Preliminary Study Shows *[*'Doctrine of Discovery' Legal Construct*](https://aila.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DOD5.pdf)* Historical Root for Ongoing Violations of Indigenous Peoples' Rights, Permanent Forum Told*

*Prepared and presented by Tonya Gonnella Frichner North American Regional Special Rapporteur  April 27, 2010*

The "Preliminary study on the impact on indigenous peoples of the international legal construct known as the Doctrine of Discovery" (E/C.19/2010/13) presented at the Ninth Session authored by Tonya Gonnella Frichner, Esq. (Onondaga Nation), former North American Representative to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. We recognize the legal construct known as the [Doctrine of Discovery](https://aila.ngo/issues/doctrine-of-discovery/) has global implications. As established in the preliminary study and reaffirmed in the more recent study, as mentioned above, the Doctrine of Discovery has been invoked as a justification for the ongoing exploitation of our lands, territories and resources which violates [UNDRIP Article 7](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf), the collective right to live in freedom and shall not be subjected to any act of genocide or violence including forcibly removing children of the group to another group.

## Introduction
In this illuminating episode of the Mapping the Doctrine of Discovery Podcast, hosts Philip P. Arnold and Sandy Bigtree sit down with author and scholar Matthew Boedy to discuss his groundbreaking new book, *The Seven Mountains Mandate: Exposing the Dangerous Plan to Christianize America and Destroy Democracy*.

## **About the Episode:** 
Matthew Boedy brings his expertise and sharp analysis to unpack the Seven Mountains Mandate---a movement within certain Christian circles that seeks to exert dominion over seven key spheres of American society: government, education, media, arts and entertainment, religion, family, and business. Through a deeply researched investigation, Boedy exposes how this ideology, rooted in dominionist theology, is actively reshaping American politics and threatening the core principles of democracy.

## **Key Topics Covered:**

-   The historical roots of the Seven Mountains Mandate and its connections to the Doctrine of Discovery.
-   The ideological and theological underpinnings of the movement.
-   How the Mandate has influenced recent political developments and policy decisions.
-   Real-life examples of the Mandate's impact on communities, governance, and public discourse.
-   The importance of exposing and challenging Christian nationalism in the fight to preserve pluralism and democratic values.
-   Boedy's insights on what's at stake for Indigenous sovereignty and religious freedom.

## **Why This Conversation Matters:** 
Arnold and Bigtree's interview with Boedy shines a light on the often-overlooked intersections between religious doctrine, colonization, and modern political agendas. By connecting the Seven Mountains Mandate to the legacies of the Doctrine of Discovery, the episode offers listeners a critical lens through which to understand ongoing threats to democracy and Indigenous rights.

## **About the Guest:** 
Matthew Boedy is an associate professor of rhetoric and composition at the University of North Georgia. His scholarship explores the intersections of religion, politics, and public discourse.

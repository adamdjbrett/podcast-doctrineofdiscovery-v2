## Introduction
- Jeannine Hill Fletcher speaks on the uncomfortable subjects that affect us all, and insists that we cannot explore justice nor equality without first addressing racial justice and equality. She discusses the forces and means used to strip Indigenous peoples of their land through indoctrination, religious conversion, marriage, and white generational inheritance of otherwise stolen land.   Jeannine insists that we must fully understand the systematic advantages that white christian culture has created and our place within it. The interview continues into matters of christian patriarchy and indigenous matriarchy, and discusses just how important it was to break the matrilineal bonds of indigenous people to subvert their culture and their connection with the land itself.

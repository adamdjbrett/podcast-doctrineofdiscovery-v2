## Introduction
Travis and Matthew together have written a powerful book on the efforts during the American Revolution to take land from Indigenous Peoples, using force, coercion, deception, and the destruction of crops. History has written that these acts were retaliatory, a response to raids committed by Haudenosaunee on frontier settlements. However this is far from the truth. The destruction of Indigenous nations was a priority above all else. American military leaders ignored peace efforts, falsified reports and oriented aggression using any means and excuses possible so that they could gain permission to raid and burn Indigenous villages and lands. These attacks were clearly intended to erode tribal cohesion and take the land by any and all means necessary, using  the ongoing Revolutionary war to justify their cause.

Join us as we speak with leaders from Soulforce to understand their approach to reclaiming spirituality, empowering grassroots movements, and fostering healing among those impacted by spiritual violence. We’ll dive into their current projects, including their advocacy work and upcoming international initiatives, to shed light on the transformative journey from oppression to liberation.

### Overview
- [Soulforce](https://soulforce.org/) is an organization that has been working for 25 years to end political and religious discrimination and oppression of LGBTQ people. They take a multifaceted approach, including public actions, theological work, and grassroots community engagement.

- A key focus of [Soulforce](https://soulforce.org/)'s work is addressing the roots of "White Christian supremacy" - how Christianity has been used as a tool of colonization, domination, and oppression of marginalized communities, including Indigenous peoples. They aim to "sabotage" this weaponized Christianity.

- [Soulforce](https://soulforce.org/) works with diverse populations, including LGBTQ Christians, Latin American faith communities, Indigenous peoples, and more, to address the trauma and violence of "spiritual violence" and to imagine liberative spiritual practices.

- Upcoming initiatives include a conference in Mexico City bringing together Latin American feminist and queer theologians, and the publication of a resource book on concepts like "Christian supremacy" and "spiritual violence" for a US audience.

## Detailed Notes
What if the very religion that once oppressed your ancestors could also be your path to liberation? This thought-provoking question sets the stage for a compelling episode of our podcast, "Reclaiming Faith: Dismantling White Christian Supremacy and Healing Through Indigenous Spirituality." In this episode, we engage with representatives from Soulforce---Reverend Alba Onofrio, Nadia Arellano, and Karina Vargas---in a deep and powerful conversation about dismantling white Christian supremacy and Christian nationalism. 

The episode opens with an introduction to the complex challenges posed by white Christian supremacy and Christian nationalism, particularly within the context of Native American Indigenous Studies and broader religious studies. The guests share their personal journeys and the mission of Soulforce, highlighting their efforts to reclaim and reframe religious narratives to include queer and feminist perspectives. The discussion reflects on a recent gathering at Syracuse University, emphasizing the importance of community and continuous dialogue in addressing these pressing issues.

As the conversation progresses, we delve into the intricate relationship between Christianity and Indigenous spirituality. The episode examines how religion, once a tool of colonialism, can now be reclaimed as a source of liberation and healing. As a queer Christian minister engaged in earth-based healing practices, I share my personal journey of reconciling these aspects while recognizing the historical harms caused by Christianity. We discuss the significance of demystifying and decoding religious systems of domination, particularly in the context of activism and academia working together to understand their origins and impacts. The discussion also highlights movements like eco-spirituality and groups reconnecting with Indigenous and Celtic spirituality as part of a broader effort to heal and reclaim our relationship with the land.

The exploration of the Doctrine of Discovery and its ongoing impact is a crucial part of the episode. We reflect on how historical strategies of colonization continue to shape and harm Indigenous and marginalized communities. Highlighting the work of Soulforce, we discuss the challenges of translating complex social science concepts into accessible language for diverse audiences, including those grappling with religious trauma. Emphasizing empathy and understanding, we underscore the importance of addressing ideological colonization and developing strategies to support survivors of violence. This segment sheds light on the profound, generational trauma rooted in fear and guilt imposed by religious colonization and underscores the necessity of healing and dismantling these oppressive systems.

A significant portion of the episode is dedicated to the liberating effects of understanding the Doctrine of Discovery and its historical context. We explore the pervasive and intimate nature of spiritual violence, discussing how it is embedded in institutions and personal relationships. Nadia highlights the complexities of these issues, particularly in the context of workshops held in Quito, Ecuador, with diverse groups including pastors, sex workers, and Indigenous midwives. Despite their devout Catholic faith, these individuals recognize and relate to the trauma discussed. The conversation underscores the importance of acknowledging and navigating the intertwined systemic and personal dimensions of spiritual and cultural trauma.

The episode also delves into the intricate dynamics of working with Latinx and Indigenous communities, particularly in the context of historical and ongoing spiritual violence perpetuated by Christian institutions. We discuss the complexities of faith within Latinx populations in the US South, who grapple with deep-rooted religious beliefs and the pain inflicted by exclusionary doctrines. The historical impact of Christianity on Indigenous communities is highlighted, showing how colonialism and religious mandates disrupted ancient traditions and communal practices. The recent apology by US Catholic bishops for their role in Native American boarding schools is examined, raising questions about the church's intentions and the pressures from affected communities. The importance of creating spaces where people can safely question religious authority and reclaim their spiritual practices is emphasized, advocating for a more inclusive and respectful approach to spirituality that honors diverse traditions.

In the final segments, we discuss the extensive spiritual resource library available at Soulforce.org, focusing on theological resources addressing gender and sexuality issues within a Christian context. We highlight translations of these resources into local languages, including efforts in Southern Africa and Spanish-speaking regions, emphasizing the historical context and interpretive decisions behind biblical texts. A significant 150-page book, currently in Spanish, covering topics such as Christian supremacy, spiritual violence, and paths to healing, is discussed, with plans for an English adaptation. Additionally, we preview an upcoming October gathering in Mexico City, bringing together Latin American, feminist, and queer theologians to address weaponized religion and spiritual violence.

The episode concludes with a focus on the intersection of Latin American theology, queer and feminist theology, and the significance of Indigenous crops and foods in reclaiming cultural identity. We explore how the colonization process disrupted Indigenous agricultural practices, replacing native crops like corn with foreign staples such as white flour, fundamentally altering ceremonies and connections to the earth. This historical impact on health and culture underscores the importance of making conscious choices, such as opting for traditional superfoods like amaranth. These choices serve as acts of rebellion against Christian hegemony.
